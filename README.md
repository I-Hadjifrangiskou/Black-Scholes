# Black-Scholes Option Pricing with Random Forest

This project uses a Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm to approximate European option prices generated by the Black-Scholes formula in Python. 

- Synthetic option prices are generated using the Black-Scholes model
- Random Forest Regressors are trained for call and put options
- Evalutes the Normalised Mean Squared Error (NMSE)
- Visualizes predictions vs. true prices.
